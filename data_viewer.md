What data to present

# For every file

- Bar graph of most held keys
- Bar graph of most key up keys
- 2D Histogram of mouse information

# Aggregate, Comparing Games to Active and then Passive

## Key hold times for each key

X-Axis: Keys, sorted by median hold times

Y-Axis: Violin and also box plot of the distributions of hold times of each key
every minute.

## Key up counts for each key

Same as above, but key up counts

## Left mouse hold times, right mouse hold times

Bar graph

X-Axis: Label (Game, Active, Passive)

Y-Axis: Boxplot and violinplot of left and right mouse hold times every minute

## Left mouse up times, right mouse up times

Same as above, but mouseup counts instead

## Scroll times

Same as above, but scroll event counts

## 2D Histogram

Compare passive, active, and game in three different 2D histograms

These should show mouse positions

There are many different displays with different resolutions, so normalize this
data to the size of the primary monitor.
