### Percentage of time key was held

Only the top 10 most held keys were shown. The graph rapidly taper off near the
end

Notice very high percentage of time held for keys used in games. "w" is held
more than 100% of the time, although this can be attributed to errors in the
recording software.

In addition, the plot for active work is more uniform than the plot for playing
games.

### Average key up counts per minute for each key

Only the top 10 most pressed keys were shown.

Notice that for games, the first few keys are frequently pressed, but there is a
large drop off after the first six keys. The first six keys correspond to
movement in the game, which explains why they are pressed the most.

On the other hand, for active work, the plot is mostly uniform, except for a
spike for the top three most pressed keys. These keys include backspace and
space, which are frequently used when writing. "t" is also one of the most
common letters in English, which also explains why it is one of the most pressed
keys.
